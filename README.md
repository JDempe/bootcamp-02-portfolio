# CBC Week 02 Challenge: Portfolio
## Description

This project is the second challenge from the coding bootcamp from UC Berkeley.  This time, we were not given any code to start with, only a goal: Make a personal portfolio.  While right now it will be fairly sparse, the framework should allow for me to expand the portfolio as I complete increasingly complex and impressive projects.

Portfolios are essential when looking for jobs in the development world.  It shows the potential employer that you can put the skills you've learned to work and create complete, well documented projects.

The requirements were:
- Profile Section - A section with my name, picture, and short description.
- Navigation - Links to other parts of the webpage.  When the link is clicked, the UI scrolls to that section.
- Projects Section - An area for displaying my deployed projects.  They should have titles and actually link to the webpage.
- Responsive Design - The webpage should rescale and reorganize with changing screen sizes to ensure user friendliness for all platforms.

## Installation

There is no installation process for this project.  It is already deployed at:

## Usage

There are several areas on the webpage that the user can interact with.
- At the top right of the page in the header, navigation links will redirect the user to the related text lower on the page.

</p>

- In the top left corner are links that will take you to my Github, LinkedIn, and open an email addressed to me.  The contact options were added to the fixed header rather than only at the bottom of the page so that they are always available.

</p>

- Hovering over the Skill Badges will reveal the tool's name.

- Hovering over the projects will scroll down the webpage image.  Clicking on the webpage image will open it in a new tab.

## Mock Up

The mock up below was provided in the bootcamp homework materials.  The homework criteria required that much of the functionality of this mock up be present, but did not provide any restriction on aesthetics or layout.

The website I ultimately created did not closely match what I had mocked up for myself before starting.  As the code for the webpage came together, it became increasingly clear that I am not naturally gifted at UI/UX design and so used a more fluid design approach for this project, playing around with different ideas until I found something workable.  Moving forward, I hope to use the lesson's learned about user friendliness, layout limitations, and my own limitations to mock up a more deployable webpage from the start.

### Resources
The below resources contributed to the decisions made on how to most effectively refactor the webpage.

- [Matt Visiwig](https://twitter.com/MattVisiwig) created an SVG background creator that provides many free options.  My background image was created from [this](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/) tool.

- [Ian Lunn](https://github.com/IanLunn) created an awesome library called [Hover.css](https://twitter.com/davidmacd) that adds some plug and play css animation classes.  I used this for some of the moving icons on my page.

- The University of Nebraska [Web Developer Link](https://wdn.unl.edu/page-title-h1-best-practices) provided a snippet of code that allowed me to have an `<h1>` tag while being invisible for accessibility and SEO purposes.

- [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6398526/javascript-jquery-or-something-to-change-text-every-some-seconds) Stack Overflow thread had a code snippet for cycling through text options in a header that I modified for my purposes.

- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) provided many of the .png and .svg icons seen throughout the webpage.

- [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) also provided freely usable media for the webpage.

- My profile picture was generated using the Microsoft [Xbox Avatar Editor](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/xbox-avatar-editor/9NBLGGH4V0R3?hl=en-us&gl=us). 

- W3 Schools has many in depth tutorials.  Their [tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) referenced heavily in creating my site.

### Collaborators

The Slack channel east-coast-study-group that is part of the bootcamp Slack group collaborated on this assignment by answering questions and providing feedback on ideas.  There was no peer code review on this assignment.
